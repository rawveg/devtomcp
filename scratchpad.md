# Dev.to MCP Server Implementation Scratchpad

## Project Overview
Creating an MCP Server application that connects to the Dev.to API, providing the following capabilities:
1. Searching Articles and Posts
2. Reading Articles and Posts
3. Creating Articles and Posts

The server will be implemented in Python using the FastMCP framework with SSE transport.
It will use SSE (Server-Sent Events) for communication rather than STDIO, allowing it to be run
as a standalone Docker container or deployed via Google Cloud Run.

## Implementation Approach Change
Initially, the implementation started as a complex multi-file REST API proxy, but this approach was incorrect.
The correct implementation is a single-file MCP server using the FastMCP library with the SSE transport.

## Critical Update: Client-Specific Authentication
A critical design flaw was identified in the initial implementation - the server was using a single API key for all operations.
The design has been updated to use client-provided API keys instead, ensuring that:
1. Each user's actions are attributed to their own Dev.to account
2. Content is created under the correct user identities
3. Authentication is properly scoped to individual clients
4. The server no longer requires its own API key (though it can have an optional fallback key)

## Progress Log

*2023-05-15: Initial implementation and approach revision*

1. Created initial project structure with multi-file organization
2. Realized the implementation did not align with MCP server methodology
3. Changed approach to a single-file MCP server using FastMCP with SSE transport
4. Implemented all required Dev.to API functionality as MCP tools
5. Created Docker configuration for containerization
6. Added comprehensive documentation
7. Set up health check and API endpoints

*2023-05-16: Project Completion*

1. Completed the server implementation with all required functionality
2. Created comprehensive documentation including README and Google Cloud Run deployment guide
3. Set up proper Docker configuration for containerization
4. Added appropriate .gitignore and other supporting files
5. Project is now ready for use

*2023-05-17: Critical Authentication Update*

1. Fixed a critical authentication design issue - changed from server-wide API key to client-provided keys
2. Updated API handlers to extract client API keys from headers or parameters
3. Modified documentation to explain the authentication approach and how to integrate it
4. Updated container configuration to reflect the optional nature of the server API key
5. Enhanced client integration examples with proper authentication

## Benefits of the Single-File Approach

1. Significantly simpler implementation
2. Direct alignment with MCP server design principles
3. Clearer separation of concerns with tools as decorated functions
4. More maintainable and understandable codebase
5. Follows the tool-based pattern of MCP interactions

## Benefits of Client-Specific Authentication

1. Each user maintains their own identity when creating/updating content
2. Server doesn't need to manage its own API key for all operations
3. Proper attribution of content to the correct Dev.to accounts
4. Maintains proper security boundaries between different clients
5. Allows for more flexible authorization models
