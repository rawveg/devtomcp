## ‚öôÔ∏è Server Configuration

The server can be configured using the following environment variables:

| Environment Variable | Description                   | Default |
|---------------------|-------------------------------|---------|
| `PORT`              | Port to run the server on      | `8000`  |
| `LOG_LEVEL`         | Logging level (INFO, DEBUG, etc.) | `INFO`  |

---

## üîê Client Authentication

Each client needs to provide their own Dev.to API key for authenticated operations. This is done securely by providing the API key as an environment variable in the client's MCP server configuration.

> **Note:** The key should be provided as `DEVTO_API_KEY` in the environment section of your MCP client configuration.

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

### üê≥ Running with Docker

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rawveg/devtomcp.git
cd devtomcp
```

2. **Build and run with Docker Compose:**

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

The server will be available at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) with the SSE endpoint at [http://localhost:8000/sse](http://localhost:8000/sse).

## üõ†Ô∏è MCP Tools

### Browsing Content
- `browse_latest_articles()` - Get the most recent articles from Dev.to
- `browse_popular_articles()` - Get the most popular articles
- `browse_articles_by_tag(tag)` - Get articles with a specific tag

### Reading Content
- `get_article(id)` - Get detailed information about a specific article
- `get_user_profile(username)` - Get information about a Dev.to user

### Searching Content
- `search_articles(query, page=1)` - Search for articles using keywords

### Managing Content (requires authentication)
- `list_my_articles(page=1, per_page=30)` - List your own published articles
- `create_article(title, content, tags="", published=False)` - Create a new article
- `update_article(id, title=None, content=None, tags=None, published=None)` - Update an existing article

---

## üñ•Ô∏è Client Configuration

### Claude Desktop Configuration

Add the MCP server in Claude Desktop's `config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "devto": {
      "url": "http://localhost:8000/sse"
    }
  }
}
```

### Cursor Configuration

Add the MCP server in Cursor's configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "devto": {
      "url": "http://localhost:8000/sse"
    }
  }
}
```

**NOTE** 

Some clients may require the use of `serverUrl` instead of `url`, eg: Windsurf IDE by Codium.

### Programmatic Access with Python

```python
import asyncio
import os
from fastmcp.client import Client

async def main():
    # Set environment variable for authentication
    os.environ["DEVTO_API_KEY"] = "your_dev_to_api_key_here"
    
    # Connect to the MCP server
    client = Client("http://localhost:8000/sse")
    
    # Use the client
    async with client:
        # Get popular articles
        results = await client.call_tool("browse_popular_articles", {})
        print(results)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deploying to Google Cloud Run

For deploying to Google Cloud Run:

1. Follow the [Google Cloud Run Quickstart](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/quickstarts/build-and-deploy) to set up your environment
2. Set up your Dev.to API key as a secret:
   ```bash
   gcloud secrets create devto-api-key --data-file=- <<< "your_api_key_here"
   ```
3. Deploy with the secret mounted:
   ```bash
   gcloud run deploy devtomcp \
     --source . \
     --set-secrets=DEVTO_API_KEY=devto-api-key:latest \
     --allow-unauthenticated
   ```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Security Warning:** 
- The `--allow-unauthenticated` flag makes your server publicly accessible
- Since this is a single-user server with your API key, you MUST implement additional security measures:
  - Use [Cloud Run Authentication](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/authenticating/overview)
  - Set up [Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP)](https://cloud.google.com/iap/docs/cloud-run-tutorial)
  - Configure [VPC Service Controls](https://cloud.google.com/vpc-service-controls/docs/overview)
  - Use [Ingress Controls](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/securing/ingress)

See [GCP_DEPLOYMENT.md](./GCP_DEPLOYMENT.md) for detailed security configuration instructions.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Error Handling

The server returns standard MCP error responses:

```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "message": "Error description",
  "code": 401
}
```

Common error codes:
- **401**: Authentication failed (missing or invalid API key)
- **404**: Resource not found
- **422**: Invalid parameters
- **500**: Server error

---

## üîí Security Considerations

- The server uses environment variables for API key configuration, providing proper security isolation
- Each client connection uses its own configured API key
- All API credential handling happens server-side
- Use HTTPS in production environments
- Use secure secret management for API keys in cloud deployments
